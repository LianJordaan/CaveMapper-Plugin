# CaveMapper-Plugin

CaveMapper-Plugin is a Java plugin for Minecraft Java servers that attempts to map out caves using glowing entities. Please note that this project is experimental and may not be well-designed, with the mapping process running instantly and the stop command being ineffective.

## Usage

To use the CaveMapper-Plugin, you will need to have a Minecraft Java server running version 1.18.2 or higher.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release of the CaveMapper-Plugin from the [releases](https://github.com/LianJordaan/CaveMapper-Plugin/releases) page.
2. Upload the downloaded JAR file to the `plugins` folder of your Minecraft server.
3. Restart your Minecraft server to load the CaveMapper-Plugin.
4. Use the following plugin commands to interact with the plugin:

- `/highlightblock`: Highlights the single block you are looking at.

- `/algorithmstop`: Stops the mapping process. Note: This command may not be effective due to the instant nature of the mapping process.
