# Cave Mapper

Cave Mapper is a Java plugin for Minecraft Java servers that aims to map out caves using glowing entities. Please note that this project is experimental and may be laggy or not suitable for practical use. However, the source code is available for anyone who wants to work on it and improve it further.

## Usage

To use the Cave Mapper plugin, you will need to have a Minecraft Java server running version 1.18.2 or higher.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release of the Cave Mapper plugin from the [releases](https://github.com/yourusername/cave-mapper/releases) page.
2. Upload the downloaded JAR file to the `plugins` folder of your Minecraft server.
3. Restart your Minecraft server to load the Cave Mapper plugin.
4. Use the plugin commands or configuration files to configure and activate the cave mapping algorithm.

### How it Works

The Cave Mapper algorithm uses glowing entities in Minecraft to map out caves. These glowing entities emit light, which illuminates the surrounding blocks. The algorithm tracks the illuminated blocks and generates a map based on the illuminated areas.
